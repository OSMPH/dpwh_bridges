These TSV files are grouped by province, which can download and edited in your favorite utility. If you have a Github account, replace "v0" in the filename with "v1", and upload your completed file in this director in Github via a Pull Request.

For example, if you chose to work on Antique province ("ANT-rbi_bridges_2022-v0.tsv"), you will be uploading the completed file copy as "ANT-rbi_bridges_2022-v1.tsv"

If you're not planning to use Github, upload the completed file in the temporary Telegram channel.

After the clean-up these will be merged again for another review, and then prepared for the micro-tasking manager.
